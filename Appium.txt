Appium has a steep learning curve, good amount of time will be spent on installation of softwares and configuration.

Here are the detailed steps to proceed
1. Tech stack - Java, Maven, Appium, Selenium WebDriver, Node.js, Appium server, Android studio (Make sure it includes SDK manager)
2. Have the below dependency included into your pom.xml

          <dependency>
                  <groupId>io.appium</groupId>
                  <artifactId>java-client</artifactId>
                  <version>6.1.0</version>
        </dependency>

3. Download and install Node.js by downloading .dmg file from https://nodejs.org/en/
4. Download and install Appium server from - http://appium.io/
5. Download and install Android Studio from - https://developer.android.com/studio
6. Before you proceed further, make sure you set the environment variables mentioned below in bash_profile.

export JAVA_HOME=/library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_171.jdk/Contents/Home
export ANDROID_HOME=/Users/<your user dir>/Library/Android/sdk
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/tools
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/tools/bin
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools
export PATH=$PATH:$JAVA_HOME/bin
7. Source ~/.bash_profile
8. Create a emulator using Android Studio by clicking on AVD manager, ensure you have the right configuration of mobile you want to work on


      i. To work with native mobile app, use "uiautomatorviewer" for finding the UI elements. The "uiautomatorviewer" is a utility which helps us capture all the UI elements.
      ii. To work on mobile browsers, make use of chrome developer tools.
      First you need to have a browser opened on the emulator and then go to the developer tools on your laptop's chrome browser and then go to console, then to "Remote Devices".
      This should help us identify your emulator and then interact with it.

9. Bring up Appium server, this works on the port 4723 by default. You can change if you want.
    We need Appium server to be up and running to interact with the emulator.

10. If you want to check on the list of devices that are connected to your system, use this command - "adb device -l".
11. Set up the below desired capabilities

DesiredCapabilities capabilities = new DesiredCapabilities();
capabilities.setCapability(MobileCapabilityType.PLATFORM_NAME, "Android");
capabilities.setCapability(MobileCapabilityType.PLATFORM_VERSION, "9");
capabilities.setCapability(MobileCapabilityType.DEVICE_NAME, "testathon");
capabilities.setCapability(MobileCapabilityType.BROWSER_NAME, "Chrome");
capabilities.setCapability(AndroidMobileCapabilityType.AUTO_GRANT_PERMISSIONS,true);
capabilities.setCapability("nativeWebScreenshot", true);
capabilities.setCapability("androidScreenshotPath", "target/screenshots");
